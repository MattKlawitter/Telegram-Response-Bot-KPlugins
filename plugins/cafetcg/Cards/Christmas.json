At last, however, Terry has finally been noticed in a set of cards based of crazy, wacky, Cafe memes and jokes! But I digress... one must know Terry's origins before seeking to judge him. It all started way back when at dragon school at the north pole. The disappearence of magical reindeer nessecitated the use of a new magical creature that could fly. Dragons! Unfortunate for Terry, he was only a young dragon at the time and, well, they wouldn't let him play any dragon games. So Terry pushed himself hard to grow up into being the best Christmas Dragon he could be! And you know what? He did it! Now Terry leads Santa Clarney's sleigh each and every year to make Christmas the best it can be. No more Rudolph stealing his thunder. Terry was gonna have what for, and HIS time in the spot light.
